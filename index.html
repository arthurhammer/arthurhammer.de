  I enjoy building delightful apps that are easy to use.
  
  <p>
    I’m the person who bridges the gap between product, design and engineering to see a vision through. I know when to be pragmatic and when to add that extra attention to detail <a href="https://github.com/arthurhammer/FrameGrabber/blob/develop/docs/about.md#technical-challenges">to stand out from competitors</a>. ✨    
  </p>
  
  <h3>Where To</h3>
  <p>
    I'm an experienced mid-level engineer ready to grow.
  </p>
  <p>
    I want to create products that make a real difference to their users. I work best with driven people who communicate openly and want to see each other succeed.
