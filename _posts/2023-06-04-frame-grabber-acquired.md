[Frame Grabber](https://web.archive.org/web/20230525192529/https://apps.apple.com/app/frame-grabber/id1434703541) has been acquired.

First things first: The app remains on the App Store. As of version 1.5, it is being published under a new owner. The [GitHub repo](https://github.com/arthurhammer/FrameGrabber) stays open-source as it has since day one. [Back in 2018]({% post_url 2018-12-08-frame-grabber %}), I made the promise of keeping the app open source as a gift to the community and I will be following through with that promise.

This has been a wild ride! After 5 years on the App Store, I felt it was time. I've babied the project from start to finish. It started out just for myself, I made it to take better pictures of my [dumb hobbies]({% post_url 2019-07-01-trail-joggling %}). Back then, I had an idea but no experience in making an app. So I sat down and got to work. Who knew that I would become a professional iOS developer based on everything I learned here?

The project ends on a high note for me. The app has thousands of daily downloads, tens of thousands of daily active users, and a 4.8 star rating world-wide. It's a good app, it solves a real problem, and it does it [really well](https://github.com/arthurhammer/FrameGrabber/blob/develop/docs/about.md#technical-challenges). It couldn't be a better time to move on.

## How it Happened

I wasn't actually looking to sell, the opportunity presented itself. About a month ago, I got an email from somebody interested in acquiring the app. After some back and forth, we arrived at an agreement and I said yes. I didn't make the decision lightly, I slept on it, I asked my friends for advice. The final offer was significant and, well, simply too hard to pass up. It makes a lot of things a lot easier to put it that way.

I've never sold an app. With Frame Grabber, I wanted to learn how to make an app from start to finish and here I am: at the finish line. So I got to figure out that part as well, just one part of the journey. I sat down and read up on everything I needed to know. There's contracts, taxes, weird laws, and more paperwork to consider. Especially when selling internationally. But it was fun learning about those things. Yes, I said fun!

## Why

I can sum it up in two points:

**Time**: I haven't had much time to improve the app recently. Pretty simple. Time is limited besides full-time work, friends, and [extensive hobbies]({% post_url 2019-07-15-zugspitz-ultratrail-2019 %}). As the user base grew, feature requests kept accumulating. Putting something out there and having people depend on it, is a responsibility. Users count on me as the developer and I started to feel guilty by not honoring that to the extent it deserves.

**Looking Ahead**: 5 years is a long time. I have felt ready to move on for some time. My journey does not end here, there are new and bigger challenges waiting for me. I want to make a new app again, start from scratch! I think about that a lot. Finding a new home for Frame Grabber would give me the necessary focus to follow through with a new app.

## What About Users

What would the acquisition mean for existing users? This was the biggest question for me and the one that made me hesitate the most.

Frame Grabber is a very accessible app, in every meaning of that word. It is free of charge (it finances itself through donations). It is privacy-friendly. It is [open-source](https://github.com/arthurhammer/FrameGrabber). And it is super easy to use. This, in part, is why users love it so much. "Trust" is a word that comes up a lot when people send in their feedback.

I definitely did not want to betray that trust.

At the same time, the app would change, that is a given. First, I guessed Frame Grabber would stop being free and switch to a subscription-model to recover the acquisition investment and increase profits. Second, I knew there is a good chance that the app and its features would significantly change. 

The first point is fine I figured: Users constantly urge me to charge for the app outside of donations. Going subscription would not be a problem. 

I was ambivalent about the second point: As I said, users depend on the app. For their hobbies and even professionally. The app is so well-received because I've spent countless hours iterating on the main use case. I had taken great care to design the UX. Going in a completely new direction here could mean disappointing users.

I did sit down with the future owner to discuss the future of the app. I had a great feeling this was the right direction. But in the end it didn't matter. It simply clicked for me: I did not want and could not make any restrictions in any way. Why should I? The app is now theirs to do as they please. I mean, that's the point of buying something, right? 

I had to let go. And I did.

## The End

As soon as the process was done, everything felt right. I felt relief. And excitement. And pride. I made a product out of nothing. And I sold it! 

So long, Frame Grabber. A wild ride from start to finish. 

Along the way, I discovered my dream career: I want to create products for people.
